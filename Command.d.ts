/**
 * The Command class is a chainable, subclassable object type that can be used to execute commands serially against a
 * remote WebDriver environment. The standard Command class includes methods from the {@link module:leadfoot/Session}
 * and {@link module:leadfoot/Element} classes, so you can perform all standard session and element operations that
 * come with Leadfoot without being forced to author long promise chains.
 *
 * In order to use the Command class, you first need to pass it a {@link module:leadfoot/Session} instance for it to
 * use:
 *
 * ```js
 * var command = new Command(session);
 * ```
 *
 * Once you have created the Command, you can then start chaining methods, and they will execute in order one after
 * another:
 *
 * ```js
 * command.get('http://example.com')
 *   .findByTagName('h1')
 *   .getVisibleText()
 *   .then(function (text) {
 *       assert.strictEqual(text, 'Example Domain');
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * Because these operations are asynchronous, you need to use a `then` callback in order to retrieve the value from the
 * last method. Command objects are Thenables, which means that they can be used with any Promises/A+ or ES6-confirmant
 * Promises implementation, though there are some specific differences in the arguments and context that are provided
 * to callbacks; see {@link module:leadfoot/Command#then} for more details.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Each call on a Command generates a new Command object, which means that certain operations can be parallelised:
 *
 * ```js
 * command = command.get('http://example.com');
 * Promise.all([
 *   command.getPageTitle(),
 *   command.findByTagName('h1').getVisibleText()
 * ]).then(function (results) {
 *   assert.strictEqual(results[0], results[1]);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, the commands on line 3 and 4 both depend upon the `get` call completing successfully but are
 * otherwise independent of each other and so execute here in parallel. This is different from commands in Intern 1
 * which were always chained onto the last called method within a given test.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Command objects actually encapsulate two different types of interaction: *session* interactions, which operate
 * against the entire browser session, and *element* interactions, which operate against specific elements taken from
 * the currently loaded page. Things like navigating the browser, moving the mouse cursor, and executing scripts are
 * session interactions; things like getting text displayed on the page, typing into form fields, and getting element
 * attributes are element interactions.
 *
 * Session interactions can be performed at any time, from any Command. On the other hand, to perform element
 * interactions, you first need to retrieve one or more elements to interact with. This can be done using any of the
 * `find` or `findAll` methods, by the `getActiveElement` method, or by returning elements from `execute` or
 * `executeAsync` calls. The retrieved elements are stored internally as the *element context* of all chained
 * Commands. When an element method is called on a chained Command with a single element context, the result will be
 * returned as-is:
 *
 * ```js
 * command = command.get('http://example.com')
 *   // finds one element -> single element context
 *   .findByTagName('h1')
 *   .getVisibleText()
 *   .then(function (text) {
 *     // `text` is the text from the element context
 *     assert.strictEqual(text, 'Example Domain');
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * When an element method is called on a chained Command with a multiple element context, the result will be returned
 * as an array:
 *
 * ```js
 * command = command.get('http://example.com')
 *   // finds multiple elements -> multiple element context
 *   .findAllByTagName('p')
 *   .getVisibleText()
 *   .then(function (texts) {
 *     // `texts` is an array of text from each of the `p` elements
 *     assert.deepEqual(texts, [
 *       'This domain is established to be used for [â€¦]',
 *       'More information...'
 *     ]);
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * The `find` and `findAll` methods are special and change their behaviour based on the current element filtering state
 * of a given command. If a command has been filtered by element, the `find` and `findAll` commands will only find
 * elements *within* the currently filtered set of elements. Otherwise, they will find elements throughout the page.
 *
 * Some method names, like `click`, are identical for both Session and Element APIs; in this case, the element APIs
 * are suffixed with the word `Element` in order to identify them uniquely.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Commands can be subclassed in order to add additional functionality without making direct modifications to the
 * default Command prototype that might break other parts of the system:
 *
 * ```js
 * function CustomCommand() {
 *   Command.apply(this, arguments);
 * }
 * CustomCommand.prototype = Object.create(Command.prototype);
 * CustomCommand.prototype.constructor = CustomCommand;
 * CustomCommand.prototype.login = function (username, password) {
 *   return new this.constructor(this, function () {
 *     return this.parent
 *       .findById('username')
 *         .click()
 *         .type(username)
 *         .end()
 *       .findById('password')
 *         .click()
 *         .type(password)
 *         .end()
 *       .findById('login')
 *         .click()
 *         .end();
 *   });
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * Note that returning `this`, or a command chain starting from `this`, from a callback or command initialiser will
 * deadlock the Command, as it waits for itself to settle before settling.
